      <h2>From local rhythms to global inequalities</h2>
      <h3><a href="https://netscix2026.github.io/" class="plain">NetSci-X | Auckland, February 2026</a></h3>
      <p>
        Human mobility unfolds at different scales, and the mechanisms that drive local trips are not the same as those that shape regional migration or global tourism. Scales manifest both spatially and temporally, as the frequencies and distances with which we move are coupled—longer trips, fewer times per day, week or year. Moreover, these scales interact: fixed travel budgets, limited by the number of hours in a day, define choice sets in the short-term and alter life courses in the long-term. This thematic session will bring together researchers of human mobility from diverse perspectives, ranging from applied network science to social science. We will consider how barriers, constraints and inequalities—from socio-economic impediments and "passport hierarchies" to disabilities and obstructions—influence effective mobility, as well as their socio-economic consequences. Our goal is to map both the causes and effects of mobility inequality across scales. This session will consist of a mix of invited and contributed talks.

        By incorporating both theoretical models and empirical studies, this session aims to (i) map how mobility varies across and between scales, (ii) uncover dependencies between local and global movement, and (iii) explore how social, economic, and political factors manifest at different scales of mobility. We aim to blend network and social sciences to create a space for exchange and discussion. We invite submissions for contributed talks on topics related to human mobility at any scale, including but not limited to: scales and invariants in human mobility, determinants of day-to-day mobility, drivers of migration, ethnic or class hierarchies in mobility, activity spaces and experienced segregation, shocks to mobility, politics of mobility. In particular, we welcome research considering the interplay of different forms of mobility, including the relationship between horizontal and vertical mobility, causes and effects of experienced segregation, and how "mobility capital" manifests across scales.
